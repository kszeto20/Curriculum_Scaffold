#Curriculum Scaffold
##An RPI RCOS Project

QuACS currently is a widely used interactive platform that helps RPI students view courses, their prerequisites, and build schedules. Although already extremely helpful, QuACS lacks the capabilities to help students get a more in-depth idea of the concepts/skills needed for different classes and what classes they need to build a cohesive degree. The main goal of the Curriculum Scaffold is to build a more interactive, and informative platform that provides students with:
    -	Prerequisites for a desired class and concepts needed from that prerequisite.
        -	Informative content for students to review concepts and bolster their understanding (eg. Links to lessons, youtube videos, notes)
    -	Information on concepts to be learned from a desired class – help them see if it seems like something that is interesting/helpful to learn
    -	Outlined “pathways”/concentrations so students can see:
        -	What classes they should take to follow their desired concentration path
    -	Which concentration the classes they have taken/will take lead to

Most of this data will be sourced from the professors that teach the content so information on content and relevant links will give a realistic idea of what can be expected from the course. 

The proof of concept and initial data population will begin with ECSE courses as a lot of data and links have been provided by faculty. For this semester, we hope to be able to develop the initial interactive architecture for the project, allow students to put the curriculum scaffold to use, and allow instructors to update and provide materials in real-time.
